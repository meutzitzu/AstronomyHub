contains only *slight* amounts of badly written stuff

notes:
-content display only site for now. no upload functionality of any kind.
-we try to keep it as simple as possible. no libraries or frameworks so far, just stock HTML and CSS, with only the absolutely necessary amount of Js.


latest update:
*AJAX has been successfully implemented*
side menu was changed from grid based to inline

next step:
re-add the sidemenu effects from the -legacy css *without* breaking the new menu
